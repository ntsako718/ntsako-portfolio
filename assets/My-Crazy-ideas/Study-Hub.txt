2. **Generate a Quiz**  
   Select intensity and topics → AI generates relevant questions.

3. **Practice or Take an Exam**  
   Choose “Exam Mode” to simulate timed tests with realistic structure.

4. **Review & Track**  
   Study Dashboard shows what you're strong or weak in, helping guide future sessions.
